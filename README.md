This Repo contains a T-SQL implementation of the fuzzy string matching algorithm using the Dice coefficient.

Dice is less restrictive then Levenshtein and other popular algorithms. It works well when first names and last names aren't in the same order in a given dataset.

Anything above .30ish is a pretty good match. Less not so great.
